# React Coding Challenge

## Description
This project contains the basis for our coding challenge.

It doesn't define any UI limitations in any way and only gives you the basic components for SEO/Links/Infinite Scrolling while creating a comfortable development environment to get started.

This repo supports both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and JavaScript, comes with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) configurations and allows you to write Unit/Integration tests out of the box.

There will be Readme's across the repo to describe the architecture as well as the challenges you will see.

## Challenges

- [Promo](src/components/Countdown/README.md)
- [TheBucket](src/components/TheBucket/README.md)
- [Countries](src/pages/countries/README.md)

Complete at least 2 of the 3 challenges presented in the repo, make sure to assess them and prioritize as you see fit.
