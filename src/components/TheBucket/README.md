# Bucket Challenge

There is a bucket represented by a button, each click on the button represents a glass of water poured into it. 
The bucket has a max amount of glasses that can hold, when that amount is reached, we say the bucket has completed a batch. 
We want to see how many batches the user can complete before the timer ends.
 
TASK: Fix the Dashboard component so that it works as expected. 

- You can only put code inside the dashboard component AND you cannot change the return value of the component.
