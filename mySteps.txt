Steps 

Config 

WHAT - added volta, to manage node version (pined node version of nvmrc)
WHY - i stoped using nvm at some point, didn't want to install it on my local env, pinning the node version as a part of the volta config was faster


Getting Info 
- read about Gastby, haven't used it before i just know what it is and what it does nothing else


PropTypes
https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide#removed-proptypes-and-defaultprops
PropTypes were deprecated in April 2017 (v15.5.0). https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html#new-deprecation-warnings
A state with proptypes and ts types could be maintained by inferring the proptypes from the ts types, choose not to because of the linked doc


Date on CountDown
Date should be used to have a more exact timer, because the useTimeout doesn't makes it a guarantee that the time will actually go down every 1 second
for example if you have tab performance saving on chrome, the timer will actually just stop.
by using init date and calculating the difference between current time and initial time you get a correct date, might need to tweak the timeout time for this to work
